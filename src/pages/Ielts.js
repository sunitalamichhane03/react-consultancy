      <div className='wrap'>
        <h4>Experienced instructors</h4>
        <p>To be able to instruct students, one needs to obtain at least band 7 in their IELTS test. Learning from somebody who has himself/herself secured good marks can help you broaden your vision towards the test.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div className='wrap'>
        <h4>Frequent revisions, tests, and guidance</h4>
        <p>You cannot know if you are good at something unless you push yourself to the limit. To push yourself, you need to know where your starting point is. For this, you need to attain tests frequently and improve accordingly with guidance. Your IELTS instructor will guide you throughout and make sure that you attain better results.</p>
