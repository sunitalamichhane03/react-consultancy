			<h2>Study Architecture and Construction in Australia</h2>
<p>Architecture is not a single field. It’s a combination of multiple fields such as art, culture, science and technology. Would you like to design bridges, houses, skyscrapers? Do you have the drive to be an artist and also have science and technology to backup your facts? If you’d like to model, design, plan and build environments then this is the right course for you. If you’d like to study Architecture and Construction in Australia, this article will guide you through the courses available, requirements and cost.</p>
<p>Architects are skilled professionals at the centre of Australia’s built environment industry, a $100 billion sector employing over a million people. Nepal is a developing country, and the way construction rates are going high, Nepal will soon hit shortage of skilled manpower. So, studying architecture and construction can be a good thing to do</p>

<ol>
<li>Design</li>
</ol>
<p>This is more like a pre-construction job. You come up with layouts and designs for the constructors. You create designs and blueprints which the constructors will bring to life. Careers in this group are: Architects, city planner ,Civil engineers, etc.</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a post construction job. Once the design and construction phases are over, you need human resource who’ll make sure that the constructed structures work smoothly.</p>
<p>Some of the individual career paths are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Architectural and civil drafter or engineer</li>
<li>Environmental designer</li>
<li>Residential or commercial carpenter</li>
