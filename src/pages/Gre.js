      <p>The Graduate Record Examinations is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for many graduate schools in the United States and Canada and a few other countries. The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing Service.
      The GRE is developed and administered by testmaker ETS to provide graduate and business schools with common measures for comparing applicants’ qualifications and preparedness for graduate-level academic work. Graduate school and business school admissions committees look at your GRE score, along with your academic record and supporting materials, to assess your readiness for the rigors of graduate academic study.

    <h2>WHAT IS ON THE GRE?</h2>
    <p>What’s tested on the GRE? The GRE measures your command of basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis, as well as college-level vocabulary. More importantly, it measures your ability to analyze and evaluate written material, think critically, and solve problems.
There are three total sections on the GRE and some test-takers face an unscored experimental or research section. You’ll tackle 80 scored questions on the GRE and two scored Analytical Writing tasks. If you are given a research or experimental section on your GRE test date, you may have to complete an additional 20 questions that won’t affect your total score.</p>

    </div>
    <div className='vocabulary'>
      <h2>WHAT ARE THE GRE SECTIONS?</h2>
      <p>You will receive three scores on the GRE.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>i.Analytical Writing</li>
        <li>ii.Verbal Reasoning</li>
        <li>iii.Quantitative Reasoning</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These scores are generated by the following sections:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>i.1 Analytical Writing Assessment section</li>
        <li>ii. 2 Verbal Reasoning sections</li>
        <li>iii. 2 Quantitative Reasoning sections</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition, you will see one of the following sections:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Unscored (may be either Verbal Reasoning or Quantitative Reasoning)</li>
        <li>Research (used for ETS research purposes)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>ANALYTICAL WRITING</h2>

<div className='detailsongree'>
<p>The Analytical Writing Assessment, or “essay” section, measures whether you can articulate your thoughts and responses to complex ideas in a clear and reasoned way. Formulating a well-supported thesis in response to new and unfamiliar topics and key to doing well on Analytical Writing.</p>
<p>During the two, separately timed tasks in Analytical Writing, you will be asked to “Analyze an Issue” and to “Analyze an Argument.” For the “Analyze an Issue” task, you will read an opinion on a topic of general interest and be given instructions on how to respond to the issue at hand. For the “Analyze an Argument” task, you will need to consider an argument according to instructions given in the prompt.</p>

<p>The Verbal section of the GRE tests your ability to analyze written material, as well as relationships among component parts of sentences, including words and concepts. Verbal Reasoning questions appear in several formats:</p>

</div>
    <div className='gretests'>
      <h2>TEXT COMPLETION</h2>
      <p>Text Completion (TC) questions ask you to fill in the blank to complete sentences. Variations include 1-, 2-, and 3-blank questions. You’ll encounter approximately six of these in each Verbal section, and you should aim to complete each in about 1–1.5 minutes. To master these, you’ll need to build your vocabulary as well as develop your skill at using context clues from the sentence to make predictions for the blanks. There is no partial credit: you must answer correctly for all blanks to receive points for these questions.

</p>
<h2>SENTENCE EQUIVALENCE</h2>
<p>Sentence Equivalence (SE) questions require you to fill in a single blank with two choices that create two coherent sentences that are logically similar in meaning. You will encounter approximately four SE questions in each Verbal section. Aim to complete each in about 1 minute. As with TC questions, you’ll need to work on building your vocabulary and identifying context clues in order to master SE questions</p>
<h2>READING COMPREHENSION</h2>
<p>Reading Comprehension (RC) questions are based on passages of one or more paragraphs that develop an explanation or argument on a topic. RC questions require you to understand central ideas presented in the text and the structure of a text, as well as to research details in the passage and draw valid inferences from it. RC questions require strategic reading and paraphrasing skills.</p>
<p>Each Verbal section will contain approximately 10 RC questions associated with five different passages, and you should aim to spend an average of 1–3 minutes on reading a passage and 1 minute per question.</p>

    </div>
    <div className='verb'>
      <h2>QUANTITATIVE REASONING (QUANT)</h2>
      <table className="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Number Of question</th>
<th>	Minutes to complete Quantitative Reasoning</th>
<th>Score range</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6 Text Completion questions
7–8 Quantitative Comparison questions<br></br>
12–13 Problem Solving questions<br></br>
20 total questions per section</td>
<td>35 minutes per section</td>
<td>	
130 to 170</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The Quant section of the GRE tests your basic quantitative skills, as well as your ability to reason and solve problems with quantitative methods. You’ll see questions covering basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis. These topics are typically covered in high school. You will not see trigonometry, calculus, or any other high-level math.</p>
<h2>QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON</h2>
<p>Quantitative Comparison (QC) questions ask you to compare two quantities—Quantity A and Quantity B—and to identify the relationship between the two. You’ll likely see about 7–8 of these in each Quant section. To master these, be familiar with the QC answer choices and with shortcut methods that allow you to compare rather than calculate.</p>
</div>
<div className='solving'>
<h2>PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>
<p>The most common Problem Solving (PS) questions are standard multiple-choice questions, with five choices and one correct answer. Variants include questions that ask you to select one or more answers from a list of choices (multiple-choice all-that-apply) and questions that ask you to enter your answer in a box (numeric entry.) To master PS questions, be familiar with the math concepts that are tested as well as strategies that allow you to approach solving efficiently.</p>
<p>There are also a handful (typically three per section) of Problem Solving questions associated with one or more charts. These Data Interpretation (DI) questions work like other PS Qs, but it’s important to note that gleaning the information correctly from the graphs is the key to answering them.</p>

</div>
<div className='goodscore'>
  <h2>WHAT IS A GOOD GRE SCORE?</h2>
  <p>When considering your GRE score goal, look at the requirements—or minimums, if applicable—at the graduate or business programs to which you’re applying. This will let you know your score baseline. If you can find the mean or average GRE score of admitted applicants, you’ll be able to determine what GRE score will make you a competitive applicant.The Verbal and Quant sections of the GRE are each scored from 130 to 170. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning is 151, and the mean score for Quantitative Reasoning is 153. The Analytical Writing Assessment is scored from 0 to 6 in half-point increments, and the mean score is 4.0. You can use the tables below to see the relationship between scaled scores and the test takers achieving them:</p>

<h2>WHEN TO TAKE THE GRE</h2>
<p>Since graduate programs have a wide range of application deadlines, you’ll want to research your programs of interest ahead of time and ensure that your GRE score can be reported in time for your earliest deadline. Your GRE score is good for five years.</p>
<p>You’ll want to devote 1–3 months to studying for the GRE, and top scorers report studying for 100+ hours.</p>
<h2>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO TAKE THE GRE?</h2>
<p>The cost to take the GRE is $205 for all testing locations except China. The fee includes sending score reports to up to four graduate institutions of your choice.</p>
